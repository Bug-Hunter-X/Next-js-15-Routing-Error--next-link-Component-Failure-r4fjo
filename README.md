# Next.js 15 Routing Bug: next/link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 related to the `next/link` component.  The routing functionality unexpectedly fails, preventing navigation to the specified page.  The root cause might stem from issues in the `next.config.js` file or an incorrect structure within the `pages` directory.

## Bug Description
The `next/link` component, when used to create a link to the '/about' page, does not navigate correctly.  Instead of loading the '/about' page, an error occurs or the application remains on the current page.

## Solution
The solution addresses the routing configuration, ensuring that the `pages` directory is structured correctly, and that any custom routing configurations within `next.config.js` do not interfere with the standard routing behavior.  This fix involves verifying the structure of `pages` and adjusting the `next.config.js` file if necessary to resolve any conflicts or improper configurations.
